    <p>During my first year as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA), I was told, as a matter of fact, that I sometimes shared brutal honesty with my students. 
        That I would be honest on things I didn't know about or that I would state that my first language was not English and that if I got stuck trying to remember a word I welcomed students to help me.
        For me, it was not being brutally honest, it was just about stating facts and being open to the students.</p>
    <p>However, for many Latinx graduate students teaching, particularly if they are a person with uterus, cis-gender identifying as woman, and young like myself, there are concerns and worries about not having the respect of students. 
        Myself, as a Latina whose English is a second-language, and teaching for the first time, I felt those concerns. 
        Regardless, I wanted my students to feel at ease. I didn't want to repeat the same patriarchal, power-driven, and oppressive banking system of education.</p>
    <p>My way to restructuring the classroom space was by acknowledging my own lack of absolute knowledge. 
        The classroom was a community of learning not one of archival knowledge, that banking system of education that expects students to sit and listen while I share my wisdom. 
        I do not consider myself wise or absolutely or entirely knowledgable. 
        I prepare myself for each class, I practice what I will share with students. 
        I expect for them to share their own stories, and all these starts with honest-honesty, not a brutal honesty (without trying to judge my teaching mentor at the moment. He was right.).</p>
    <p>Coming from a multicultural background as a Puerto Rican in the U.S., I see in teaching a door to a range of possibilities. 
        These possibilities include but are not limited to becoming humans, acquiring knowledge, critical thinking, creating community, and developing a sense of self. 
        Who are we in regards to the world? Who are we in relation with the world? 
        By bringing a more clearer honesty to the classroom environment I believe students are able to, less-scared, acknowledge the value of their ideas for my and their environments. 
        They are given a chance to share their voice without seeming stupid or unknowledgeable, because I have already posed the limits of my own knowledge bank. 
        Both students and me are learning.</p>
    <p>Of course, as an instructor, I have already acquired information and knowledge that permits me to lead the discussions. 
        However, this is merely for me to guide students to pose their own questions, arguments, and thoughts. 
        Honest-honesty becomes the push for an inviting learning space, one where I put myself in the spot by sharing my own stories when needed, and showing students connections between the classroom and reality, as well as the opportunities for learning in that honesty.</p>
    <p>To conclude this small reflection on pedagogy, I would like to finish with a quote from Paulo Freire. 
        In Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1970), he argues against the banking system of education. 
        For him, this system consists of the lecturer (instructor) sharing knowledge to the students and listeners (students) who listen and just take in the information. 
        For him, this method of teaching and learning was faulty. I bring this particular scholar due to his great influence in my own teaching philosophy and approaches. 
        Freire states:</p>
    <p>The teacher talks about reality as if it were motionless, static, compartmentalized, and predictable. 
        Or else he expounds on a topic completely alien to the existential experience of the students. 
        His task is to "fill" the students with the contents of its narration―contents which are detached from reality, disconnected from the totality that engendered them and could give them significance. 
        Words are emptied of their concreteness and become a hollow, alienated, and alienating verbosity.
        ― Paulo Freire</p>
    <p>I don't intend to share the contents of my own narration and that's what my honest-honesty tries to engage students with; with the realities of the ever-growing and forever expanding universe of knowledge. 
        By instating honest-honesty ―a honesty of vulnerability and connection between students and teacher―, the learning experience becomes human and considering of the students realities and own opinions.
        Therefore, this little reflection on why I use honest-honesty rather than calling it brutal honesty, brings up lots of critical issues in academia and learning spaces. 
        I hope that those that read it find either inspiration or a topic to thing more about regarding teaching and learning.</p>
    <p>Until the next one!</p>
